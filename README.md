## Dependencies

You can install all dependencies by running one of the following commands

You need a [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) to use the environment setting.

```python

conda env create -f environment.yml 

```

Or you can manually install the required libraries (see the contents of the environemnt*.yml files) using pip.
