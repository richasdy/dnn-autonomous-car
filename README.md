# dnn-autonomous-car

## Dependencies

You can install all dependencies by running one of the following commands

You need a [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) to use the environment setting.

```python

# Use auto-rccar
conda env create -f auto-rccar-environments.yml 

# Use udacity without GPU
conda env create -f udacity-environment.yml 

# Use udacity with GPU
conda env create -f udacity-gpu-environmentenvironment.yml
```

Or you can manually install the required libraries (see the contents of the environemnt*.yml files) using pip.
